  <h2>Responsive Image</h2>
  <p>When the CSS width property is set in a percentage value,
    the image will scale up and down when resizing the browser window.
    Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>
  <!-- resize image will work without meta in head -->
  <!-- Notice that the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size.
  A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead. -->
