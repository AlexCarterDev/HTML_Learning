  <!-- blockquote - a section that is quoted from another source
  cite - Specifies the source of the quotation. The cite attribute does not render as anything special
  in any of the major browsers, but it can be used by search engines to get more information about the quotation.
  Most web browsers add some indenting (about 5 spaces) to both sides of a blockquote
  to make it stand out from the surrounding text. Some extremely old browsers may
  even render the quoted text in italics.-->
